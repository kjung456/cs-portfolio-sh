        <h1>Hardware</h1>
        
        <h2>Motherboard</h2>
<p class="hardwarep">The motherboard is the mainframe  of the computer, which all other componets interface. The motherboard is the central circuit board making up a complex electronic system. A motherboard provides the electrical connections by which the other componts of the system communitcate. The motherboard includes many componets such as: central processing unit(CPU), random access memory(RAM), firmware, and internal and external buses.<br> <img class=hardware-image src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/MicroATX_Motherboard_with_AMD_Athlon_Processor_2_Digon3.jpg width="350" height="350"></p>
        <h2>Central Processing Unit</h2>
<p class="hardwarep"> The Central Processing Unit, also known as CPU, is the machine that executes the computer programs. It is often referred to the brain of the comupter. <br> <img class=hardware-image src=http://www.globalspec.com/ImageRepository/LearnMore/201311/chips8b74c2a3d3b543d58e6a4540e6469e25.png width="340" height="275"> There are four steps that nearly all CPUs use while operating. They are fetch, decode, execute, and writeback. In the fetch step,the CPU receives the instruction from program memory. In the decode step, the instruction is broken up into parts that have significance to other portions of the CPU. During the execute step various portions of the CPU are connnected so they can perform the desired operation. In the final step named writeback, the operation wrties back the results of the execute step to some form of memory.</p>        
        <h2>Random Access Memory</h2>
<p class="hardwarep">Random access memory (RAM) is fast-access memory that is cleared when the computer is power-down. RAM attaches directly to the motherboard, and is used to store programs that are currently running. RAM is a set of integraited circuits that allow the stored data to be accessed in any random order. There are many different types of RAM. The distinctions they all have between each other is writable vs.read-only, static vs. dynamic, and volatile vs non-volatile etc.<img class=hardware-image src=http://s3.amazonaws.com/digitaltrends-uploads-prod/2014/05/ddr4_2.jpg height="350" width="375"></p>
