        <br><h2 id="motherboard">Motherboard</h2>
<p class="hardwarep">The motherboard is the mainframe  of the computer, which all other componets interface. The motherboard is the central circuit board making up a complex electronic system. A motherboard provides the electrical connections by which the other componts of the system communitcate. The motherboard includes many componets such as: central processing unit(CPU), random access memory(RAM), firmware, and internal and external buses.<br> <img class=hardware-image src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/MicroATX_Motherboard_with_AMD_Athlon_Processor_2_Digon3.jpg width="350" height="350"></p>
        <br><h2 id="CPU">Central Processing Unit</h2>
<p class="hardwarep"> The Central Processing Unit, also known as CPU, is the machine that executes the computer programs. It is often referred to the brain of the comupter. <br> <img class=hardware-image src=http://www.globalspec.com/ImageRepository/LearnMore/201311/chips8b74c2a3d3b543d58e6a4540e6469e25.png width="340" height="275"> There are four steps that nearly all CPUs use while operating. They are fetch, decode, execute, and writeback. In the fetch step,the CPU receives the instruction from program memory. In the decode step, the instruction is broken up into parts that have significance to other portions of the CPU. During the execute step various portions of the CPU are connnected so they can perform the desired operation. In the final step named writeback, the operation wrties back the results of the execute step to some form of memory.</p>        
        <br><h2 id="RAM">Random Access Memory</h2>
<p class="hardwarep">Random access memory (RAM) is fast-access memory that is cleared when the computer is power-down. RAM attaches directly to the motherboard, and is used to store programs that are currently running. RAM is a set of integraited circuits that allow the stored data to be accessed in any random order. There are many different types of RAM. The distinctions they all have between each other is writable vs.read-only, static vs. dynamic, and volatile vs non-volatile etc.<img class=hardware-image src=http://s3.amazonaws.com/digitaltrends-uploads-prod/2014/05/ddr4_2.jpg height="350" width="375"></p>        
        <br><h2 id="hard-drive">Hard Drive</h2> 
<p class="hardwarep">The hard drive is a mpart of the computer where the saved files are even when the computer is shut off. For this reason is why the hard drive is ised to save files. A typical hard drive is 500-1000 GB, but in laptops it tends to be less. You can add additional storage anytime.<br> <img class=hardware-image src=http://www.dansdata.com/images/samsung_ecogreen/hd103ui1024.jpg width=350 height=350> </p>
        <br><h2 id="monitor">Monitor</h2>
<p class="hardwarep"> A monitor is a piece of computer hardware that displays the video and graphichs information thta is generated by the video card. Monitors are similar to televisions, but monitors show its information at a higher resolution.<br> <img class=hardware-image src=http://images.costco-static.com/image/media/500-994756-847__1.jpg width=350 height=350></p>
        <br><h2 id="mouse">Mouse</h2>
<p class="hardwarep"> A computer mouse is a hand operated computer device. The mouse controls the coordinates of your cursor on the monitor. The cursor moves as you move the mouse. <img class=hardware-image src=http://societyupdate.asse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/D_iStock_000007207702Medium.jpg width=300 height=300></p>
        <br><h2 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h2>  
<p class="hardwarep"> A keyboard is a computer device. The keyboard is used to input text, characters, and other commands into the computer.<img class=hardware-image src=http://www.omgchrome.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/chromebox-keyboard.jpg width=375 height=250></p>
        <br><h2 id="communicate">How do they communicate?</h2>
<p class="hardwarep">The first step is to power on the computer. When the switch is activated, a signal is sent to the power supply, this allows all of the computer hardware to get the right amount of power needed to operate. The power supply then sends signals to the CPU and motherboard. Everything is connected to the motherboard, with this everything goes through the motherboard to get to other componets of the computer. When the computer is finally on, you can use the mouse to control the cursor or use the keyboard to type in text when needed. The data from the keyboard or mouse is communicated through the motherboard and shown onto the monitor. <img class=hardware-image src=http://www.computerheadz.com/desktop-computer.jpg width=350 height=250> </p>
